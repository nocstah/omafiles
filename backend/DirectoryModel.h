// Asynchronous directory listing and file system watching.
// replacement for list-dir.sh + Utils.parseEntries: it scans with direct
// readdir/stat/lstat, without a fork per file nor a NUL-delimited shell pipe.
// See BACKEND_DESIGN.md.
//
// DATA PROVIDER, not a Qt model: the architectural
// decision of AUDIT-V2 was Option B. The UI NEVER consumed this as
// ListView.model -- `NavState.entries` (the real list model) is
// fed from FOUR heterogeneous sources (normal dir, recursive search,
// file content, trash), which produce arrays; a QAbstractListModel
// could not represent the last three. So this type exposes only the
// `entries` array (+error/watch) and the dead roles, the
// QAbstractListModel and its interface (rowCount/data/roleNames) were removed.
// Measured: the scan dominates (~80% of the listing at 50k); the only cost that
// a model-with-roles would have avoided (building the QVariantList) is <20% and
// only in rare folders >10k. See the table in the AUDIT-V2 revalidation.
//
// EXACT parity with list-dir.sh (which is what allows comparing and, later,
// replacing without changing behaviour):
//   - folders first, then files;
//   - within each group, case-insensitive order with the SAME glibc
//     collation that `sort -f` uses (wcscoll_l over a locale_t from the env);
//   - a symlink to a dir counts as a dir; a broken one goes to files with the
//     link's own size/mtime (lstat), state "broken";
//   - folder size forced to 0, like the script;
//   - error codes equivalent to the exit codes (2/3/4/1).
//
// It is registered as the QML type Omafiles.Backend.DirectoryModel; consumed by
// list different paths at once, each its own instance).

  // with an O(1) string comparison on the UI thread, instead of the
  // O(n) Utils.entriesEqual that iterated the 100k entries and, in doing so,
  // FORCED the lazy materialization of the whole array (measured: 342 ms of
  // UI blocking at 100k per refresh). The hash is computed on the worker thread,
