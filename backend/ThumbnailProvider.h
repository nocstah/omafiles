// C++ backend for thumbnails. Generates thumbnails of images
// (PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF/SVG) and PDF (first page) with QImageReader, caches
// them on disk and serves them by file PATH -- just as the project
// already did with the PDF/video thumbnails (Image { source: <path> }), which
// (which we do not control). See BACKEND_DESIGN.md 5.3.
//
// Persistent cache in ~/.cache/omafiles/thumbnails/. The key is a hash
// (SHA-1) of path+max-size+file-size+mtime: if the image
// changes (different mtime/size) the key changes and it regenerates on its
// own (invalidation by path+size+mtime, as the requirement asks).
//
// Asynchronous: request() returns immediately. If the thumbnail is already in
// the cache it returns its path; if not, it returns "" and generates it on a
// thread of the QThreadPool, emitting ready(path, thumbPath) on completion. For
// unsupported types it returns "" and does not generate (the UI keeps its icon
// glyph).
//
// QML singleton (Omafiles.Backend.ThumbnailProvider). No dependency on
// Quickshell: only public Qt.
